1. 2 times - Calculation error/typo due to lack of concentration.

2. 2 times - Mis-handling degenerate cases(0, 1, -1, ... etc)

3. 1 time - Not thinking through carefully and realizing solution doesn't work or is incomplete while implementing.

4. 1 time - accumulate(int*, int*, int) function overflow.

5. 1 time - The relation a^e (mod p) = a^(e (mod p-1)) (mod p) doesn't hold when a = 0 (mod p) and e = 0 (mod p - 1). Always avoid taking modulo of exponents. Write bigexp function for long long exponents instead.
