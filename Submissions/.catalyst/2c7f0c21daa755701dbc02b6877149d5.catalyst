And as any other big boss he has a spacious, richly furnished office with two crystal chandeliers. To stay motivated Vasya needs the color of light at his office to change every day. That's why he ordered both chandeliers that can change its color cyclically. For example: red&nbsp;–&nbsp;brown&nbsp;–&nbsp;yellow&nbsp;–&nbsp;red&nbsp;–&nbsp;brown&nbsp;–&nbsp;yellow and so on. </p><p>There are many chandeliers that differs in color set or order of colors. And the person responsible for the light made a critical mistake&nbsp;— they bought two different chandeliers.</p><p>Since chandeliers are different, some days they will have the same color, but some days&nbsp;— different. Of course, it looks poor and only annoys Vasya. As a result, at the $$$k$$$-th time when chandeliers will light with different colors, Vasya will become very angry and, most probably, will fire the person who bought chandeliers.</p><p>Your task is to calculate the day, when it happens (counting from the day chandeliers were installed). You can think that Vasya works every day without weekends and days off.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le n, m \\le 500\\,000$$$; $$$1 \\le k \\le 10^{12}$$$)&nbsp;— the number of colors in the first and the second chandeliers and how many times colors should differ to anger Vasya.</p><p>The second line contains $$$n$$$ <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">different</span> integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2 \\cdot \\max(n, m)$$$) that describe the first chandelier's sequence of colors.</p><p>The third line contains $$$m$$$ <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">different</span> integers $$$b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le b_i \\le 2 \\cdot \\max(n, m)$$$) that describe the second chandelier's sequence of colors.</p><p>At the $$$i$$$-th day, the first chandelier has a color $$$a_x$$$, where $$$x = ((i - 1) \\mod n) + 1)$$$ and the second one has a color $$$b_y$$$, where $$$y = ((i - 1) \\mod m) + 1)$$$.</p><p>It's guaranteed that sequence $$$a$$$ differs from sequence $$$b$$$, so there are will be days when colors of chandeliers differs.</p>","outSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Output</div><p>Print the single integer&nbsp;— the index of day when Vasya will become angry.</p>","noteHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Note</div><p>In the first example, the chandeliers will have different colors at days $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$ and $$$5$$$.

You need to find prefix of minimal length which contains exactly $$$k$$$ positions $$$i$$$ such that $$$a_i \\neq b_i$$$.</p><p>Let's notice that we can use binary search. So we need to count number of positions $$$i$$$ such that $$$a_i \\neq b_i$$$ on prefix of length $$$x$$$.</p><p>Because all integers in $$$a_i$$$ are distinct (and also in $$$b_i$$$), we need to calculate number of non-negative solutions:</p><p>$$$$$$\\begin{cases} pos \\equiv x \\pmod{n} \\\\ pos \\equiv y \\pmod{m}\\end{cases}$$$$$$ </p><p>If $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ are coprime, the value can be calculated with Chinese remainder theorem.

There are many ways to do this, for example, you can precalculate solutions of all equations. And complexity becomes $$$O((n + m) \\cdot (\\log(k) + \\log(n + m)))$$$</p></div>"}
