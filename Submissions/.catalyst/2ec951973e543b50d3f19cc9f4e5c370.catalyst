The $$$i$$$-th square has three integers $$$p_i,a_i,b_i$$$, written on it. The sequence $$$p_1,p_2,\\dots,p_n$$$ forms a permutation.</p><p>Each round you will start from the leftmost square $$$1$$$ and jump to the right. If you are now on the $$$i$$$-th square, you can do one of the following two operations:</p><ol> <li> Jump to the $$$i+1$$$-th square and pay the cost $$$a_i$$$. If $$$i=n$$$, then you can end the round and pay the cost $$$a_i$$$. </li><li> Jump to the $$$j$$$-th square and pay the cost $$$b_i$$$, where $$$j$$$ is the leftmost square that satisfies $$$j &gt; i, p_j &gt; p_i$$$. If there is no such $$$j$$$ then you can end the round and pay the cost $$$b_i$$$. </li></ol><p>There are $$$q$$$ rounds in the game. To make the game more difficult, you need to maintain a square set $$$S$$$ (initially it is empty). You <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">must</span> pass through these squares during the round (other squares can also be passed through). The square set $$$S$$$ for the $$$i$$$-th round is obtained by adding or removing a square from the square set for the $$$(i-1)$$$-th round. </p><p>For each round find the minimum cost you should pay to end it.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$, $$$q$$$ ($$$1\\le n,q\\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) &nbsp;— the number of squares and the number of rounds.</p><p>The second line contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$p_1,p_2,\\dots,p_n$$$ ($$$1\\le p_i\\le n$$$).
