For simplicity, we will restrict the problem to the case where the pins are placed in vertices of a convex polygon.</p><p>Then, take a non-stretchable string of length $$$l$$$, and put it around all the pins. Place a pencil inside the string and draw a curve around the pins, trying to pull the string in every possible direction. The picture below shows an example of a string tied around the pins and pulled by a pencil (a point $$$P$$$).</p><center> <img class=\"tex-graphics\" src=\"https://espresso.codeforces.com/7fc6d0e632b37a9a0e664bd4411d3e2577e196e9.png\" style=\"max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;\"> </center><p>Your task is to find an area inside this curve.
