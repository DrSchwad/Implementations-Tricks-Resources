{"title":"D. Makoto and a Blackboard","contestId":"1097","contestName":"Hello 2019","problemIndex":"D","timeLimit":"2 seconds","memLimit":"256 megabytes","inputFormat":"standard input","outputFormat":"standard output","problemHtml":"<p>Makoto has a big blackboard with a positive integer $$$n$$$ written on it. He will perform the following action exactly $$$k$$$ times:</p><p>Suppose the number currently written on the blackboard is $$$v$$$. He will randomly pick one of the divisors of $$$v$$$ (possibly $$$1$$$ and $$$v$$$) and replace $$$v$$$ with this divisor. As Makoto uses his famous random number generator (RNG) and as he always uses $$$58$$$ as his generator seed, each divisor is guaranteed to be chosen with equal probability.</p><p>He now wonders what is the expected value of the number written on the blackboard after $$$k$$$ steps.</p><p>It can be shown that this value can be represented as $$$\\frac{P}{Q}$$$ where $$$P$$$ and $$$Q$$$ are coprime integers and $$$Q \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{10^9+7}$$$. Print the value of $$$P \\cdot Q^{-1}$$$ modulo $$$10^9+7$$$.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The only line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 10^{15}$$$, $$$1 \\leq k \\leq 10^4$$$).</p>","outSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Output</div><p>Print a single integer — the expected value of the number on the blackboard after $$$k$$$ steps as $$$P \\cdot Q^{-1} \\pmod{10^9+7}$$$ for $$$P$$$, $$$Q$$$ defined above.</p>","noteHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Note</div><p>In the first example, after one step, the number written on the blackboard is $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$ or $$$6$$$ — each occurring with equal probability.
