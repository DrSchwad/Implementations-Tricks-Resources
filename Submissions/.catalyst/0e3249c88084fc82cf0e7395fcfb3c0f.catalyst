Unfortunately, they are busy high school students, so they can only go hiking on scratch paper.</p><p>A permutation $$$p$$$ is written from left to right on the paper. First Qingshan chooses an integer index $$$x$$$ ($$$1\\le x\\le n$$$) and tells it to Daniel. After that, Daniel chooses another integer index $$$y$$$ ($$$1\\le y\\le n$$$, $$$y \\ne x$$$).</p><p>The game progresses turn by turn and as usual, Qingshan moves first. The rules follow: </p><ul> <li> If it is Qingshan's turn, Qingshan must change $$$x$$$ to such an index $$$x'$$$ that $$$1\\le x'\\le n$$$, $$$|x'-x|=1$$$, $$$x'\\ne y$$$, and $$$p_{x'}&lt;p_x$$$ at the same time. </li><li> If it is Daniel's turn, Daniel must change $$$y$$$ to such an index $$$y'$$$ that $$$1\\le y'\\le n$$$, $$$|y'-y|=1$$$, $$$y'\\ne x$$$, and $$$p_{y'}&gt;p_y$$$ at the same time. </li></ul><p>The person who can't make her or his move loses, and the other wins. You, as Qingshan's fan, are asked to calculate the number of possible $$$x$$$ to make Qingshan win in the case both players play optimally.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\\le n\\le 10^5$$$)&nbsp;— the length of the permutation.</p><p>The second line contains $$$n$$$ distinct integers $$$p_1,p_2,\\dots,p_n$$$ ($$$1\\le p_i\\le n$$$)&nbsp;— the permutation.</p>","outSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Output</div><p>Print the number of possible values of $$$x$$$ that Qingshan can choose to make her win.</p>","noteHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Note</div><p>In the first test case, Qingshan can only choose $$$x=3$$$ to win, so the answer is $$$1$$$.</p>","sampleTestcases":[{"id":1615377914754,"input":"5\n1 2 5 4 3\n","output":"1\n","result":{"id":1615377914754,"stdout":"1\n","stderr":"","exitcode":0,"signal":null,"time":151,"timeout":false}},{"id":1615377914755,"input":"7\n1 2 4 6 5 3 7\n","output":"0\n","result":{"id":1615377914755,"stdout":"0\n","stderr":"","exitcode":0,"signal":null,"time":113,"timeout":false}}],"submitUrl":"https://codeforces.com/contest/1495/submit","language":"c++","langId":"54"}
