And the $$$i$$$-th ring was either gold or silver. For convenience Saruman wrote down a binary string $$$s$$$ of $$$n$$$ characters, where the $$$i$$$-th character was <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">0</span> if the $$$i$$$-th ring was gold, and <span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">1</span> if it was silver.</p><p>Saruman has a magic function $$$f$$$, which takes a binary string and returns a number obtained by converting the string into a binary number and then converting the binary number into a decimal number. For example, $$$f(001010) = 10, f(111) = 7, f(11011101) = 221$$$.</p><p>Saruman, however, thinks that the order of the rings plays some important role. He wants to find $$$2$$$ pairs of integers $$$(l_1, r_1), (l_2, r_2)$$$, such that:</p><ul><li> $$$1 \\le l_1 \\le n$$$, $$$1 \\le r_1 \\le n$$$, $$$r_1-l_1+1\\ge \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor$$$ </li><li> $$$1 \\le l_2 \\le n$$$, $$$1 \\le r_2 \\le n$$$, $$$r_2-l_2+1\\ge \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor$$$ </li><li> Pairs $$$(l_1, r_1)$$$ and $$$(l_2, r_2)$$$ are distinct. That is, at least one of $$$l_1 \\neq l_2$$$ and $$$r_1 \\neq r_2$$$ must hold.</li><li> Let $$$t$$$ be the substring $$$s[l_1:r_1]$$$ of $$$s$$$, and $$$w$$$ be the substring $$$s[l_2:r_2]$$$ of $$$s$$$. Then <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">there exists non-negative integer $$$k$$$, such that $$$f(t) = f(w) \\cdot k$$$.</span></li></ul><p>Here substring $$$s[l:r]$$$ denotes $$$s_ls_{l+1}\\ldots s_{r-1}s_r$$$, and $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes rounding the number down to the nearest integer.</p><p>Help Saruman solve this problem!
