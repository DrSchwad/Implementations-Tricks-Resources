However, it seems like you first want to match each point with either of its moves and then some pairs of points to each other. That doesn't sound viable but since the matchings are often connected with graphs, the graph idea might come handy.</p><p>Let's first consider a pair of matched points. What does it actually mean that there exists a line through their new coordinates and $$$(0, 0)$$$? It's the same as: the angles of a line through the new coordinates of $$$a$$$ and $$$(0, 0)$$$ and a line through the new coordinates of $$$b$$$ and $$$(0, 0)$$$ are the same. Angles are the same means that their tangents are the same (and vice versa since we only consider the first quadrant of the plane). So we can conclude that $$$\\frac{y}{x+1}$$$ or $$$\\frac{y+1}{x}$$$ of the first point should be equal to any of these of the second point.</p><p>Now consider the following graph. Various values of tangents of the lines are the nodes. Each point produces an edge between their $$$\\frac{y}{x+1}$$$ and $$$\\frac{y+1}{x}$$$. What are the matched pairs of points in this graph? It's such a pair of edges that they share at least one endpoint.</p><p>Building a graph is the slowest part of the solution since you have to use some data structure (or at least a sort and a binary search). $$$O(n)$$$ is possible with some sort of hashmap but $$$O(n \\log n)$$$ should be perfectly fine as well.</p><p>So we reduced the problem to a more well-known one: given an arbitrary undirected graph, find the maximum number of pairs of edges such that each pair shares at least one endpoint and each edge is included in no more than one pair.</p><p>The upper bound on the answer is the following. Let $$$m_i$$$ be the number of edges in the $$$i$$$-th connected component. Best case we can make $$$\\lfloor \\frac{m_i}{2} \\rfloor$$$ pairs from it. Let's come up with an algorithm to achieve this bound.</p><p>Consider a dfs tree of a component. It's known that a dfs tree of an undirected graph contains no cross edges. So if we direct all the edges of a dfs tree downwards (convert all back edges to forward edges), each edge will connect some vertex to its descendant. </p><p>Imagine we came up with a dfs such that $$$dfs(v)$$$ matches all the edges that have their upper node in the subtree of $$$v$$$ to each other (except one edge in case there is an odd number of them). $$$dfs(root)$$$ will solve the task exactly then.</p><p>How should that dfs work exactly?</p><p>What if there were no forward edges at all? That case is easy since all edges are tree edges. We'll try to maintain an invariant that the only unmatched edge is an edge that has $$$v$$$ as one of its endpoints. If $$$v$$$ is a leaf, then there's nothing to match. Otherwise, we go into some child $$$u$$$. If it can't match all its edges, then match its remaining edge to an edge $$$(v, u)$$$. If it can then remember that we have an edge $$$(v, u)$$$ unmatched so far. Go into another child $$$w$$$. Same, match our edge with its edge if it has one unmatched. However, if $$$(v, w)$$$ turned out to get unmatched and $$$(v, u)$$$ turned out to be unmatched, then you can match them to each other. This way you will be left with at most one unmatched edge after you process all the children, and that edge has its endpoint at $$$v$$$.</p><p>Add the forward edges back. Did anything change? Look at the forward edge that has its upper vertex the lowest. We can see that it points to a vertex $$$u$$$ that has its subtree fully matches. So why don't we treat this forward edge the same as an edge to a leaf? Forget that $$$u$$$ has some subtree of its own and just believe that you can't match the edge $$$(v, u)$$$ so far. Proceed the same as the easy case.</p><p>Since we mark exactly which edges you pair up with which, it's trivial to retrieve the answer.</p><p>Overall complexity: $$$O(n)/O(n \\log n)$$$.</p></div>"}
