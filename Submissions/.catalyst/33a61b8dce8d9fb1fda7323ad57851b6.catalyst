A rooted tree has a special vertex called the root. The parent of a vertex $$$v$$$ (different from root) is the previous to $$$v$$$ vertex on the shortest path from the root to the vertex $$$v$$$.

The vertex $$$1$$$ is the root. In one operation you can choose any bud with all its children (they are leaves) and re-hang them to any other vertex of the tree. By doing that you delete the edge connecting the bud and its parent and add an edge between the bud and the chosen vertex of the tree. The chosen vertex cannot be the bud itself or any of its children. All children of the bud stay connected to the bud.</p><p>What is the minimum number of leaves it is possible to get if you can make any number of the above-mentioned operations (possibly zero)?</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The input consists of multiple test cases.
