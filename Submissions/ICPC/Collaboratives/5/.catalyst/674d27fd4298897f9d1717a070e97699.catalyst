There is $$$n\\times n$$$ grid, initially empty. We refer to the cell in row $$$i$$$ and column $$$j$$$ by $$$(i, j)$$$ for $$$1\\le i, j\\le n$$$. There is an infinite supply of tokens that come in $$$3$$$ colors labelled $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, and $$$3$$$.</p><p>The game proceeds with turns as follows. Each turn begins with Alice naming one of the three colors, let's call it $$$a$$$. Then, Bob chooses a color $$$b\\ne a$$$, chooses an empty cell, and places a token of color $$$b$$$ on that cell.</p><p>We say that there is a <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">conflict</span> if there exist two adjacent cells containing tokens of the same color. Two cells are considered adjacent if they share a common edge.</p><p>If at any moment there is a conflict, Alice wins. Otherwise, if $$$n^2$$$ turns are completed (so that the grid becomes full) without any conflicts, Bob wins.</p><p>We have a proof that Bob has a winning strategy. Play the game as Bob and win.</p><p>The interactor is <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">adaptive</span>.
