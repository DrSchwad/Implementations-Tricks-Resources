It seems that sometimes unordered_map becomes so slow. But it can improve with these two lines of code:

unordered_map<int, int> mp;
mp.reserve(1024);
mp.max_load_factor(0.25);

With these two lines unordered_map becomes about 10 times faster. You can replace 1024 with another suitable power of two(it depends on number of insert s you will do).
