1. dist[source] must be known beforehand.
2. If state y can be transitioned from state x, then there must be a way to get a candidate value dist[y]_x transitioned from dist[x].
3. If state y can be transitioned from state x, then the candidate value dist[y]_x of y transitioned from dist[x] must satisfy -> dist[y]_x >= dist[x].
