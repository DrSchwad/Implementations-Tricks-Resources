Suppose our hungarian algorithm finds the maximum matching, but it follows the constraint that every row must be matched with a column. 
But if our problem doesn't require every row to be matched and some cells in the sample are negative, then the algorithm might return smaller matchings.
In that case, just replace all the negative cells with 0 and then run the algorithm. This way all those negative cells are as good as being ignored by the algorithm.
